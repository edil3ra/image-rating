* Introduction

* Technical side
** backend
*** express
	I choose express to store images and informations on them, express is a very good choice for a small app like this.
	The database is one json file, I used locki to store collection to my db.
	In a real app mongo should be used, bot for now file persintig database is good engough.
	Image are sorted in locals.
	The image hame no processing except for the checking of file type.
	In real app i will used a service like cloudinary or create my own processing image service.
  


** front
*** Materialize
   I Choose materialize because, it is one of the fastest way to get a good looking web app without too much work
*** React
   I choose react because it's a good choice for small project like this.
   I took 2 react library to create the the dropzone and to display the image
*** Redux
   I choose redux to manage all the state of the app, it's overkill for smal project but redux is really convenient to manage states
